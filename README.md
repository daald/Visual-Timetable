## Welcome to the Visual-Timetable project!

First of all: Visual-Timetable is a project mainly for me and to show the SBB how they can improve their [personal timetable service](http://timetable.sbb.ch/bin/query-p2w.exe/dn)

I never planned to give big support for it. But this doesn't meen that you are not allowed to fork and improve it. And maybe there is really someone who has the time to make it something better than it is ought to be today: just a help for me to see which train rolls me back home every evening :-)

## What is this?
Visual Timetable is a fully client-side HTML5 application for displaying timetables for trains, buses, trams etc. in a nice and easy-to-read SVG graphic. It uses the external frameworks [RaphaÃ«l](http://raphaeljs.com/) for SVG output plus [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). Currently this is a very early alpha (or just call it a proof of concept). It only supports Swiss Timetables and it doesn't even have (good-working) forms for user input.
